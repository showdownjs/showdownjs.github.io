Sub-extension object properties A sub-extension object should have a type property that defines the type of the sub-extension, and either regex and replace properties or a filter property . Type Type is a required property that defines the nature of the corresponding sub-extensions. It takes one of the two values: lang : language extension to add new Markdown syntax to Showdown. lang extensions have the highest priority in the subparser order, so they are called after escaping and normalizing the input text and before calling any other subparser (or extension). When to use lang type For example, if you want the ^^youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 syntax to automatically be rendered as an embedded YouTube video. output : output extension (or modifier) to alter the HTML output generated by Showdown. output extensions have the lowest priority in the subparser order, so they are called right before the cleanup step and after calling all other subparsers. When to use output type For example, if you want the <div class=\"header\"> to become <header> . Regex and replace regex / replace properties are similar to the Javascript's string.replace function and work the same way: regex : a string or a RegExp object. If regex is a string , it will automatically be assigned a g (global) modifier, that is, all matches of that string will be replaced. replace a string or a function . If replace is a string , you can use the $1 syntax for group substitution, exactly as if it were making use of string.replace . Regex and replace example In this example, all the occurrences of markdown will be replaced with showndown . var myext = { type : 'lang' , regex : /markdown/g , replace : 'showdown' }; Filter Alternately, if you'd like to have more control over the modification process, you can use filter property. This property should be used as a function that acts as a callback. The callback should receive the following parameters: text : the source text within the Showdown's engine. converter : the full instance of the current Showdown's converter object. options : the options used to initialize the converter The filter function should return the transformed text . If it doesn't, it will fail silently and return an empty output. Filter example var myext = { type : 'lang' , filter : function ( text , converter , options ) { // ... do stuff to text ... return text ; } }; Use filter with care Although Filter extensions are more powerful, they have a few pitfalls that you should keep in mind before using them, especially regarding the converter parameter. Since the converter parameter passed to the filter function is the fully initialized instance, any change made to it will be propagated outside the scope of the filter function and will remain there until a new converter instance is created. So, it is not recommended to make ANY change to the converter object . Another aspect is that if you call the converter recursively, it will call your extension itself at some point. It may lead to infinite recursion in some circumstances, and it's up to you to prevent this. A simple solution is to place a kind of safeguard to disable your extension if it's called more than x times: var x = 0 ; var myext = { type : 'lang' , filter : function ( text , converter ) { if ( x < 3 ) { ++ x ; someSubText = converter . makeHtml ( someSubText ); } } }; Register an extension To let Showdown know what extensions are available, you need to register them in the Showdown global object. To register an extension, call the showdown.extension function with two parameters: the first one is the extension name; the second one is the actual extension. showdown . extension ( 'myext' , myext ); Test an extension The Showdown test runner is configured to automatically test cases for extensions. To add test cases for an extension: Create a new folder under ./test/extensions that matches with the name of the .js file in ./src/extensions . Place any test cases into the filter using the md/html format. These cases will automatically be executed when running tests. Additional information Escape and normalization Showdown performs the following escape/normalization: Replaces \u00a8 (trema) with \u00a8T Replaces $ (dollar sign) with \u00a8D Normalizes line endings ( \\r , \\r\\n are converted into \\n ) Uses \\r as a char placeholder This only applies to language extensions since these chars are unescaped before output extensions are run. Keep in mind that these modifications happen before language extensions are run, so if your extension relies on any of those chars, you have to make the appropriate adjustments. Implementation concerns One of the concerns is maintaining both client-side and server-side compatibility. You can do this with a few lines of boilerplate code.: ( function ( extension ) { if ( typeof showdown !== 'undefined' ) { // global (browser or node.js global) extension ( showdown ); } else if ( typeof define === 'function' && define . amd ) { // AMD define ([ 'showdown' ], extension ); } else if ( typeof exports === 'object' ) { // Node, CommonJS-like module . exports = extension ( require ( 'showdown' )); } else { // showdown was not found so an error is thrown throw Error ( 'Could not find showdown library' ); } }( function ( showdown ) { // loading extension into showdown showdown . extension ( 'myext' , function () { var myext = { /* ... actual extension code ... */ }; return [ myext ]; }); })); In the code above, the extension definition is wrapped in a self-executing function to prevent pollution of the global scope. It has another benefit of creating several scope layers that can be useful for interaction between sub-extensions global-wise or local-wise. It is also loaded conditionally to make it compatible with different loading mechanisms (such as browser, CommonJS, or AMD).","title":"Create an extension"},{"location":"create-extension/#sub-extension-object-properties","text":"A sub-extension object should have a type property that defines the type of the sub-extension, and either regex and replace properties or a filter property .","title":"Sub-extension object properties"},{"location":"create-extension/#type","text":"Type is a required property that defines the nature of the corresponding sub-extensions.

Although Showdown has evolved since its inception, in \"vanilla mode\", it tries to follow the original markdown spec (henceforth referred as vanilla) as much as possible. There are, however, a few important differences, mainly due to inconsistencies in the original spec, which Showdown addressed following the author's advice as stated in the markdown's \"official\" newsletter . Showdown also supports opt-in features, that is, an \"extra\" syntax that is not defined in the original spec. Users can enable these features via options (All the new syntax elements are disabled by default). This document provides a quick reference of the supported syntax and the differences in output from the original markdown.pl implementation. Paragraphs Paragraphs in Showdown are one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines. On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped \"destroyer\" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide. On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles. The implication of the \"one or more consecutive lines of text\" is that Showdown supports \"hard-wrapped\" text paragraphs. It means the following examples produce the same output: A very long line of text A very long line of text If you do want to add soft line breaks (which translate to <br> in HTML) to a paragraph, you can do so by adding 3 space characters to the end of the line. You can also force every line break in paragraphs to translate to <br> (as Github does) by enabling the option simpleLineBreaks . Headings Atx Style You can create a heading by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # determines the level of the heading. This is similar to atx style . # The 1st level heading (an <h1> tag) ## The 2nd level heading (an <h2> tag) \u2026 ###### The 6th level heading (an <h6> tag) The space between # and the heading text is not required but you can make it mandatory by enabling the option requireSpaceBeforeHeadingText . You can wrap the headings in # . Both leading and trailing # will be removed. ## My Heading ## If, for some reason, you need to keep a leading or trailing # , you can either add a space or escape it: # # My header # # #\\# My Header \\# # Setext style You can also use setext style headings, although only two levels are available. This is an H1 ============= This is an H2 ------------- There is an awkward effect when a paragraph is followed by a list. This effect appears on some circumstances, in live preview editors. You can prevent this by enabling the option smoothPreview . Header IDs Showdown automatically generates bookmark anchors in titles by adding an id property to a heading. # My cool header with ID < h1 id = \"mycoolheaderwithid\" > My cool header with ID </ h1 > This behavior can be modified with options: noHeaderId disables automatic id generation; ghCompatibleHeaderId generates header ids compatible with github style (spaces are replaced with dashes and a bunch of non alphanumeric chars are removed) prefixHeaderId adds a prefix to the generated header ids (either automatic or custom). headerLevelStart sets the header starting level. For instance, setting this to 3 means that # header will be converted to <h3> . Read the README.md for more info Blockquotes You can indicate blockquotes with a > . In the words of Abraham Lincoln: > Pardon my french Blockquotes can have multiple paragraphs and can have other block elements inside. > A paragraph of text > > Another paragraph > > - A list > - with items Bold and Italic You can make text bold or italic. *This text will be italic* **This text will be bold** Both bold and italic can use either a * or an _ around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed. **Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.** Strikethrough With the option [ strikethrough ][] enabled, Showdown supports strikethrough elements. The syntax is the same as GFM, that is, by adding two tilde ( ~~ ) characters around a word or groups of words. a ~~strikethrough~~ element a strikethrough element Emojis Since version 1.8.0, Showdown supports Github's emojis. A complete list of available emojis can be found here . this is a :smile: smile emoji this is a smile emoji Code formatting Inline formats Use single backticks (`) to format text in a special monospace format. Everything within the backticks appear as-is, with no other special formatting. Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project` . < p > Here's an idea: why don't we take < code > SuperiorProject </ code > and turn it into < code > **Reasonable**Project </ code > . </ p > Multiple lines To create blocks of code you should indent it by four spaces. this is a piece of code If the option ghCodeBlocks is activated (which is by default), you can use triple backticks ``` to format text as its own distinct block. Check out this neat program I wrote: ``` x = 0 x = 2 + 2 what is x ``` Lists Showdown supports unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists. Unordered lists You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either * , - , or + . Markers are interchangeable too. * Item + Item - Item Ordered lists You can make an ordered list by preceding list items with a number. 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 The actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output that Showdown produces. So you can use the same number in all items if you wish to. For example: 1. Item 1 1. Item 2 1. Item 3 2. Item 1 2. Item 2 2. Item 3 TaskLists (GFM Style) Showdown supports GFM-styled takslists if the tasklists option is enabled. - [x] checked list item - [ ] unchecked list item checked list item unchecked list item List syntax List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. * valid list item * this is valid too * this is too List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab. To make lists look nicer, you can wrap items with hanging indents: * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. * Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing. But if you want to be lazy, you don't have to If one list item is separated by a blank line, Showdown will wrap all the list items in <p> tags in the HTML output. So this input: * Bird * Magic * Johnson results in: < ul > < li >< p > Bird </ p ></ li > < li >< p > Magic </ p ></ li > < li >< p > Johnson </ p ></ li > </ ul > This differs from other Markdown implementations such as GFM (GitHub) or CommonMark. Nested blocks List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab: 1. This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. 2. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing. This is valid for other block elements such as blockquotes: * A list item with a blockquote: > This is a blockquote > inside a list item. or even other lists. Nested lists You can create nested lists by indenting list items by four spaces. 1. Item 1 1. A corollary to the above item. 2. Yet another point to consider. 2. Item 2 * A corollary that does not need to be ordered. * This is indented four spaces * You might want to consider making a new list. 3. Item 3 This behavior is consistent with the original spec but differs from other implementations such as GFM or CommonMark. Prior to version 1.5, you just needed to indent two spaces for it to be considered a sublist. You can disable the four spaces requirement with option disableForced4SpacesIndentedSublists To nest a third (or more) sublist level, you need to indent 4 extra spaces (or 1 extra tab) for each level: 1. level 1 1. Level 2 * Level 3 2. level 2 1. Level 3 1. Level 1 Nested code blocks You can nest fenced codeblocks the same way you nest other block elements, by indenting by four spaces or a tab: 1. Some code: ```js var foo = 'bar' ; console . log ( foo ); ``` To put an indented style code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented twice \u2014 8 spaces or two tabs: 1. Some code: var foo = 'bar'; console.log(foo); Links Simple If you wrap a valid URL or email in <> it will be turned into a link whose text is the link itself. link to <http://www.google.com/> this is my email <somedude@mail.com> In the case of email addresses, Showdown also performs a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting spambots. You can disable this obfuscation by setting encodeEmails option to false . With the option simplifiedAutoLink enabled, Showdown will automagically turn every valid URL it finds in the text body into links without the need to wrap them in <> . link to http://www.google.com/ this is my email somedude@mail.com Inline You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ] , and then wrapping the link in parentheses ( ) . For example, a hyperlink to github.com/showdownjs/showdown , with a link text that says, Get Showdown! will look as follows: [Get Showdown!](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) Reference Style You can also use the reference style, like this: this is a [ link to google ][ 1 ] [ 1 ]: www.google.com Showdown also supports implicit link references: this is a link to [ google ][] [ google ]: www.google.com Images In Markdown, the syntax for images is similar to that of links, supporting both inline and reference styles as well. The only difference in syntax for images is the leading exclamation mark before brackets: ![] . Inline Inline image syntax looks like this: ![ Alt text ]( url/to/image ) ![ Alt text ]( url/to/image \"Optional title\" ) That is: An exclamation mark: ! followed by a set of square brackets [ ] containing the alt attribute text for the image followed by a set of parentheses ( ) containing the URL or path to the image and an optional title attribute enclosed in double or single quotes. Reference Style Reference-style image syntax looks like this: ![Alt text][id] Where id is the name of a defined image reference. Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references: [ id ]: url/to/image \"Optional title attribute\" Implicit references are also supported: ![showdown logo][] [ showdown logo ]: http://showdownjs.github.io/demo/img/editor.logo.white.png Image dimensions When the option parseImgDimensions is activated, you can define the image dimensions, like this: ![ Alt text ]( url/to/image =250x250 \"Optional title\" ) or in reference style: ![Alt text][id] [ id ]: url/to/image =250x250 Base64 encoded images Showdown supports Base64 encoded images, both reference and inline style. Since version 1.7.4 , Showdown supports wrapping of base64 strings, which are usually extremely long lines of text. You can add newlines arbitrarily, as long as they are added after the , character. inline style ![ Alt text ]( data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7l jmRAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAAY SURBVBhXYwCC/2AAZYEoOAMs8Z+BgQEAXdcR7/Q1gssAAAAASUVORK5CYII= ) reference style ![Alt text][id] [ id ]: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7l jmRAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7D AcdvqGQAAAAYSURBVBhXYwCC/2AAZYEoOAMs8Z+BgQEAXdcR7/Q1gssAAAAASUVORK5CYII= With reference-style base64 image sources, regardless of \"wrapping\", a double newline is required after the base64 string to separate them from a paragraph or other text block (but references can be adjacent): Wrapped reference style ![Alt text][id] ![Alt text][id2] [ id ]: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7l jmRAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7D AcdvqGQAAAAYSURBVBhXYwCC/2AAZYEoOAMs8Z+BgQEAXdcR7/Q1gssAAAAASUVORK5CYII= [ id2 ]: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7l jmRAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7D AcdvqGQAAAAYSURBVBhXYwCC/2AAZYEoOAMs8Z+BgQEAXdcR7/Q1gssAAAAASUVORK5CYII= this text needs to be separated from the references by 2 newlines Tables Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM. You can enable them in Showdown via the option tables . Colons can be used to align columns. The outer pipes ( | ) are optional, matching GFM spec. You don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can use other Markdown syntax inside them. | Tables | Are | Cool | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | **col 3 is** | right-aligned | $1600 | | col 2 is | *centered* | $12 | | zebra stripes | ~~are neat~~ | $1 | Mentions Showdown supports GitHub mentions by enabling the option ghMentions . This will turn every @username into a link to their github profile. hey @tivie , check this out Since version 1.6.2, you can customize the generated link in mentions with the option ghMentionsLink . For example, setting this option to http://mysite.com/{u}/profile : < p > hey < a href = \"http://mysite.com/tivie/profile\" > @tivie </ a > , check this out </ p > Handle HTML in markdown documents Showdown, in most cases, leaves HTML tags untouched in the output document: some markdown **here** <div>this is *not* **parsed** </div> < p > some markdown < strong > here </ strong ></ p > < div > this is *not* **parsed** </ div > However, the content of <code> and <pre><code> tags is always escaped. some markdown **here** with <code>foo & bar <baz></baz></code> < p > some markdown < strong > here </ strong > with < code > foo &amp; bar &lt; baz &gt;&lt; /baz &gt; </ code ></ p > If you want to enable markdown parsing inside a specific HTML tag, you can use the html attribute markdown , markdown=\"1\" , or data-markdown=\"1\" . some markdown **here** <div markdown=\"1\">this is *not* **parsed** </div> < p > some markdown < strong > here </ strong ></ p > < div markdown = \"1\" >< p > this is < em > not </ em > < strong > parsed </ strong ></ p ></ div > Escape entities Escape markdown entities Showdown allows you to use backslash ( \\ ) to escape characters that have special meaning in markdown's syntax and generate literal characters instead. For example, if you want to surround a word with literal underscores (instead of an HTML <em> tag), you can use backslashes before the underscores, like this: \\_literal underscores\\_ Showdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters: \\ backslash ` backtick * asterisk _ underscore {} curly braces [] square brackets () parentheses # hash mark + plus sign - minus sign (hyphen) . dot ! exclamation mark Escape HTML tags Since version 1.7.2 , backslash escaping of HTML tags is supported when backslashEscapesHTMLTags option is enabled. \\<div>a literal div\\</div> Known differences and gotchas In most cases, Showdown's output is identical to that of Perl Markdown v1.0.2b7. What follows is a list of all known deviations. Please file an issue if you find more. Since version 1.4.0, Showdown supports the markdown=\"1\" attribute , but for older versions, this attribute is ignored. This means: <div markdown=\"1\"> Markdown does *not* work in here. </div> You can only nest square brackets in link titles to a depth of two levels: [[fine]](http://www.github.com/) [[[broken]]](http://www.github.com/) If you need more, you can escape them with backslashes. A list is single paragraph if it has only 1 line break separating items and it becomes multi-paragraph if ANY of its items is separated by 2 line breaks : - foo - bar - baz becomes < ul > < li >< p > foo </ p ></ li > < li >< p > bar </ p ></ li > < li >< p > baz </ p ></ li > </ ul > This new ruleset is based on the comments of Markdown's author John Gruber in the Markdown discussion list .","title":"Showdown's Markdown syntax"},{"location":"markdown-syntax/#introduction","text":"Showdown was created by John Fraser as a direct port of the original parser written by Markdown's creator, John Gruber.

The attacker injects spurious HTML content (a script) on the web page. This script can read the user\u2019s cookies and do other malicious actions (like steal credentials). As a countermeasure, you should always filter user input for suspicious content. Showdown doesn\u2019t include an XSS filter, so you must provide your own. But be careful in how you do it. Markdown is inherently unsafe Markdown syntax allows the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. For example, below is a perfectly valid Markdown: This is a regular paragraph. <table> <tr><td>Foo</td></tr> </table> This is another regular paragraph. This means that an attacker could do something like this: This is a regular paragraph. <script>alert('xss');</script> This is another regular paragraph. While alert('xss'); is hardly problematic (maybe just annoying) a real-world scenario might be a lot worse. Obviously, you can easily prevent this kind of this straightforward attack. For example, you can define a whitelist for Showdown that will contain a limited set of allowed HTML tags. However, an attacker can easily circumvent this \"defense\". Whitelist / blacklist can't prevent XSS Consider the following Markdown content: hello <a href=\"www.google.com\">*you*</a> As you can see, it's a link, nothing malicious about this. And <a> tags are pretty innocuous, right? Showdown should definitely allow them. But what if the content is slightly altered, like this: hello <a name=\"n\" href=\"javascript:alert('xss')\">*you*</a> Now this is a lot more problematic. Once again, it's not that hard to filter Showdown's input to expunge problematic attributes (such as href in <a> tags) of scripting attacks. In fact, a regular HTML XSS prevention library should catch this kind of straightforward attack. At this point you're probably thinking that the best way is to follow Stackoverflow's cue and disallow embedded HTML in Markdown. Unfortunately it's still not enough. Strip HTML tags is not enough Consider the following Markdown input: [ some text ]( javascript:alert('xss' )) Showdown will correctly parse this piece of Markdown input as: < a href = \"javascript:alert('xss')\" > some text </ a > In this case, it was Markdown's syntax itself to create the dangerous link. HTML XSS filter cannot catch this. And unless you start striping dangerous words like javascript (which would make this article extremely hard to write), there's nothing you can really do to filter XSS attacks from your input. Things get even harder when you tightly mix HTML with Markdown. Mixed HTML/Markdown XSS attack Consider the following piece of Markdown: > hello <a name=\"n\" > href=\"javascript:alert('xss')\">*you*</a> If you apply an XSS filter to filter bad HTML in this Markdown input, the XSS filter, expecting HTML, will likely think the <a> tag ends with the first character on the second line and will leave the text snippet untouched. It will probably fail to see that the href=\"javascript:\u2026\" is part of the <a> element and leave it alone. But when Markdown converts this to HTML, you get this: < blockquote > < p > hello < a name = \"n\" href = \"javascript:alert('xss')\" >< em > you </ em ></ a ></ p > </ blockquote > After parsing with Markdown, the first > on the second line disappears because it was the blockquote marker in the Markdown blockquote syntax. As a result, you\u2019ve got a link containing an XSS attack! Did Markdown generate the HTML? No, the HTML was already in plain sight in the input. The XSS filter couldn\u2019t catch it because the input doesn\u2019t follow HTML rules: it\u2019s a mix of Markdown and HTML, and the filter doesn\u2019t know a dime about Markdown. Mitigate XSS So, is it all lost? Not really. The answer is not to filter the input but rather the output . After the input text is converted into full-fledged HTML, you can reliably apply the correct XSS filters to remove any dangerous or malicious content. Also, client-side validations are not reliable. It should be a given, but in case you're wondering, you should (almost) never trust data sent by the client. If there's some critical operation you must perform on the data (such as XSS filtering), you should do it SERVER-SIDE not client-side. HTML XSS filtering libraries are useful here since they prevent most of the attacks. However, you should not use them blindly: a library can't predict all the contexts and situations your application may face. Conclusion Showdown tries to convert the input text as closely as possible, without any concerns for XSS attacks or malicious intent. So, the basic rules are: removing HTML entities from Markdown does not prevent XSS . Markdown syntax can generate XSS attacks. XSS filtering should be done after Showdown has processed input, not before or during . If you filter before, it will break some of Markdown\u2019s features and will leave security holes. perform the necessary filtering server-side, not client-side . XSS filtering libraries are useful but should not be used blindly.

The purpose is to show how easy it is to include and configure Showdown in your project. The fully working example you can see in Fiddle . Step 1: Prepare project Install node.js . Install project package management tool Showdown core library doesn't have any dependencies so the setup is pretty straightforward. However, you are strongly encouraged to use a package manager such as npm or yarn to manage project dependencies. To install package management tool: Create a directory called showdown-editor and recreate the following structure: showdown-editor \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 style.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 js \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 script.js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html Initialize package.json file by running the following interactive console command: npm init -y This command creates package.json file in the root of the project folder, and populates the default content that you can change later if you wish. Step 2: Install Showdown Inside the showdown-editor directory, run the following command: npm install showdown --save This command will install showdown inside the node_modules directory and save showdown as a dependency in the package.json file. Step 3: Update project files Add the following content to the corresponding project files: index.html style.css script.js <!DOCTYPE HTML> < html > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" /> < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"css/style.css\" /> </ head > < body > < textarea id = \"sourceTA\" rows = \"10\" cols = \"82\" > Showdown Tutorial ================= This is a showdown tutorial. Showdown supports a number of cool features, namely: - headers - lists - and other stuff too It is also possible to include code: var foo = 'bar'; var baz = { markdown: 'is great', showdown: 'is awesome' } Don't forget to check the [extensions wiki][1]. [1]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/extensions </ textarea > < hr /> < button id = \"runBtn\" onClick = \"run()\" > Convert </ button > < hr /> < div id = \"targetDiv\" ></ div > < script src = \"node_modules/showdown/dist/showdown.min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"js/script.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Please note how Showdown and the script file are included to the index.html via the script tag at the bottom of the file. # sourceTA { display : block ; } # targetDiv { border : 1 px dashed #333333 ; width : 600 px ; height : 400 px ; } function run () { var text = document . getElementById ( 'sourceTA' ). value , target = document . getElementById ( 'targetDiv' ), converter = new showdown . Converter (), html = converter . makeHtml ( text ); target . innerHTML = html ; } The script.js file is simple: when the runBtn button is clicked, the script gets the text of the textarea, passes it through Showdown to convert the markdown text into HTML. The resulting HTML is then put inside the targetDiv , replacing the previous content. Step 4: Check the result Open your index.html file. You should see your editor with prefilled markdown text in the text area. Click Convert button. You show see the text to be converted to HTML: The fully working example you can see in Fiddle .

Install project package management tool Showdown core library doesn't have any dependencies so the setup is pretty straightforward. However, you are strongly encouraged to use a package manager such as npm or yarn to manage project dependencies. To install package management tool: Create a directory called showdown-editor and recreate the following structure: showdown-editor \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 style.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 js \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 script.js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html Initialize package.json file by running the following interactive console command: npm init -y This command creates package.json file in the root of the project folder, and populates the default content that you can change later if you wish.","title":"Step 1: Prepare project"},{"location":"tutorials/markdown-editor-with-showdown/#step-2-install-showdown","text":"Inside the showdown-editor directory, run the following command: npm install showdown --save This command will install showdown inside the node_modules directory and save showdown as a dependency in the package.json file.","title":"Step 2: Install Showdown"},{"location":"tutorials/markdown-editor-with-showdown/#step-3-update-project-files","text":"Add the following content to the corresponding project files: index.html style.css script.js <!DOCTYPE HTML> < html > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" /> < link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"css/style.css\" /> </ head > < body > < textarea id = \"sourceTA\" rows = \"10\" cols = \"82\" > Showdown Tutorial ================= This is a showdown tutorial. Showdown supports a number of cool features, namely: - headers - lists - and other stuff too It is also possible to include code: var foo = 'bar'; var baz = { markdown: 'is great', showdown: 'is awesome' } Don't forget to check the [extensions wiki][1].

These extensions can be executed sequentially or at different moments. This enables you to pre-parse/mark a block of text but defer any modifications for the last by using a combination of language and output extensions. This is useful if you, for example, don't want Showdown to parse the contents of your new language construct. Example Let's say you create an extension that captures everything between %start% and %end% . However, that content should not be modified by Showdown. Obviously, you can use <pre> tags but that is beside the point. Although Showdown doesn't have any flag to prevent parsing the content of an extension, the same effect can be easily achieved by using lang and output extensions together. The fully working example you can see in Fiddle . Code Create your extensions with the following content: showdown . extension ( 'myExt' , function () { var matches = []; return [ { type : 'lang' , regex : /%start%([^]+?)%end%/gi , replace : function ( s , match ) { matches . push ( match ); var n = matches . length - 1 ; return '%PLACEHOLDER' + n + '%' ; } }, { type : 'output' , filter : function ( text ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < matches . length ; ++ i ) { var pat = '<p>%PLACEHOLDER' + i + '% *<\\/p>' ; text = text . replace ( new RegExp ( pat , 'gi' ), matches [ i ]); } //reset array matches = []; return text ; } } ] }); In this example, you created a lang extension that: Checks for the pseudo tags %start% and %end% . Extracts everything in between the tags. Saves the content between the tags in a variable. Replaces the saved content with a placeholder to identify the exact position of the extracted text. and an output extension that replaces the placeholder with the saved content, once Showdown is finished parsing.","title":"Use language and output extensions on the same block"},{"location":"tutorials/use-both-extension-types-together/#use-language-and-output-extensions-on-the-same-block","text":"","title":"Use language and output extensions on the same block"},{"location":"tutorials/use-both-extension-types-together/#overview","text":"Showdown allows you to define and use any number of extensions that act on the same block.
