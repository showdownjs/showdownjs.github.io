Since then, it has seen a lot of improvements, with a boost to performance and a significant number of features now included in the core of the library. However, do to backwards compatibility constrains, we are still supporting a lot of legacy features, that prevent us from moving the software forward.\n\nWith that in mind, **it is time to start thinking about Showdown version 2.0.** For the next major release of Showdown we have planned a range of **significant changes and additions**."

With a version 2.0 in the oven (and the exciting reverse parser already completed), it seemed an excellent opportunity for doing something that I wished for a long time: rewriting showdown's parser from scratch. But maybe that challenge was a lot more tough than I first anticipated!"
